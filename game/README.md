# PuzzleGame: Yanjitu
## ABSTRACT 
The design philosophy of Yanjitu Tangram Puzzle game is to share traditional Chinese culture with users during the game. In order to integrate fun and knowledge, we tried to develop new ways of designing as follows: First, the game serves as a vehicle to tell a story, which is narrated along a continuous timeline and in poetic language. Second, traditional Chinese culture is the key in selecting relevant game elements. UI, game design and background music all follow a classical style. Therefore, users can experience the charm of traditional Chinese culture from multiple dimensions when they are playing the game.
